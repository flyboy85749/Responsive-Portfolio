                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <img class="image-home" src="assets/images/bill_portfolio.jpg" alt="description of image">
                        <p>I've had many roles over the years, from son and brother, to pilot and professional
                            photographer,
                            but the role that resonates most with me today is that of web developer.</p>
                        <p>I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and moved to Arizona in 2000, with my then wife, four
                            dogs and a parakeet.
                            Since then I have had many avocations, but have always been searching for
                            that vocation that both challenges me and holds my interest. I love learning, coding, and
                            solving problems;
                            web development seemed to be the perfect fit.</p>
                        <p>So, I got some library books on HTML/CSS and PHP/MySql, and taught myself enough to get
                            some friends and family to allow me to build websites for them. From there, I eventually
                            built up a part-time freelance business.
                            That was about ten years ago or so, and now I am starting over in a new town, with new
                            skills, and (hopefully) new clients.</p>
                        <p>If you are looking for someone to create a website or to build an application that is
                            uniquely yours,
                            be sure to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> for a quote or to address any questions or
                            concerns
                            you may have before we begin.
                        </p>
