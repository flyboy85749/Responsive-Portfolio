                            <h2>About Me</h2>
                            <img class="image-home" src="assets/images/bill_portfolio.jpg" alt="description of image">
                            <p>I've had many roles over the years, from son and brother, to pilot and professional
                                photographer,
                                but the role that resonates most with me today is that of web developer.<br>
                                I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and moved to Arizona in 2000, with my then wife,
                                four
                                dogs and a parakeet.
                                Since then I have had many avocations, but have always been searching for
                                that vocation that both challenges me and holds my interest. I love learning, coding,
                                and
                                solving problems;
                                web development seemed to be the perfect fit.<br>
                                So, I got some library books on HTML/CSS and PHP/MySql, and taught myself enough to get
                                some friends and family to allow me to build websites for them. From there, I eventually
                                built up a part-time freelance business.
                                That was about ten years ago or so, and now I am starting over in a new town, with new
                                skills, and (hopefully) new clients.<br>
                                If you are looking for someone to create a website or to build an application that is
                                uniquely yours,
                                be sure to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> for a quote or to address any questions
                                or
                                concerns
                                you may have before we begin.
