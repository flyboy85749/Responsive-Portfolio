            <p>
              I've had many roles over the years, from son and brother, to pilot
              and professional photographer, but the role that resonates most
              with me today is that of web developer.<br />
              I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and moved to Arizona in
              2000, with my then wife, four dogs and a parakeet. Since then I
              have had many avocations, but have always been searching for that
              vocation that both challenges me and holds my interest. I love
              learning, coding, and solving problems; web development seemed to
              be the perfect fit.<br />
              So, I got some library books on HTML/CSS and PHP/MySql, and taught
              myself enough to get some friends and family to allow me to build
              websites for them. From there, I eventually built up a part-time
              freelance business. That was about ten years ago or so, and now I
              am starting over in a new town, with new skills, and (hopefully)
              new clients.<br />
              If you are looking for someone to create a website or to build an
              application that is uniquely yours, be sure to
              <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> for a quote or to address
              any questions or concerns you may have before we begin.
